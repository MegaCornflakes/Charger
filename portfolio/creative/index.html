        <span class='maintext'>&emsp;As a child, Ms. Holmes never expected to experience the horrors of a war. Now in 1940, at 5 years old, she’s right in the middle of one and has to leave there urgently. Getting out of there was going to be hard; everyone else had the same idea. The saddest part of leaving took place when she left her dog, Whoopi.<a href='#1' class='note-link'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Holmes thinks it might be the most she cried in her entire life. In order to clear the danger, they moved south. On the way to safety, they were frequently forced to leap out of their car in need of dodging the planes strafing and bombing in the area.<a href='#2' class='note-link'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Holmes recalls her mother comforting her and distracting her to make sure she never felt scared. One of the worst problems pertaining to the situation was the hunger. She got home one day and asked her mother for some food and she started to cry saying she didn’t have anything. It was hard to get anything to eat during that time. (Removed a sentence here)<br> &emsp;
        Still, throughout the whole thing, she managed to stay calm. This is all thanks to her mother. Even during the most frightening of situations, Holmes’ mother was, miraculously, able to keep her soothed. Looking back on the situation, she gives great amounts of respect and gratitude to her mother. She recalls her being able to keep them happy and making sure that she wouldn’t be sad, miserable, or in any ways negative. At the end, she concludes that she felt amazing during the whole thing.<br><br>

        &emsp;Drowsily, Will opened his eyes to see the familiar cat adoption room of his local animal shelter, the one he adopted his cat, and only friend, Cocoa, at. Fluorescent lights are beaming down on the bright, white floor, and the mostly bare walls are painted a light, sky blue, dotted with various pictures of animals once housed in the public facility.<a href='#3' class='note-link'><sup>[3]</sup></a> However, something was a bit off. Will lurched forward to get a better look. All of it, the whole room, seemed large. Scarily large. He leaped backwards in surprise, only to knock into the metal bars that usually would keep the feline visitors in their kennels. Only then did Will take a closer look at the world currently surrounding him. The space around him wasn’t the cluttered, almost unlivable apartment he was used to Instead, the floor, walls, and ceiling were all made of the same, yellowish material, and there was a large bed in one corner. Fastened to the metal bars were two bowls, one filled with small brown pellets and the other filled with fresh water. Plagued by hunger, but still slightly sleepy, Will slowly stumbled to the first bowl with the pellets. He reached out his hand to grab some of the pellets, hoping it was some kind of edible substance. Instead of a human hand reaching up to the bowl, though, a small, grey colored paw appeared instead. Will suddenly realized what was going on. “I must be a cat!” he thought. “But if this is true, then why do I have memories of a human life?” He never got to finish that thought, because soon after, one of the shelter volunteers strolled in through the door in order to start the morning routine.<br>&emsp;
        After a long day of playing and affection from volunteers and visitors throughout the day, Will was exhausted. Once everyone had left, he laid down on the cat bed in the corner and started to figure everything out. “If I’m a cat, but have human memories, I must have been a human in the past,” he began thinking. “But who was I back then?” Will strained to remember for a good amount of time before suddenly remembering his last moments as a human all at once.
        It was a cold, Friday night in October. Will was 25. He had just finished eating at a restaurant near his apartment building and was driving home to go to bed. While he was on the road, Will slipped into a microsleep that only lasted 5 seconds. Despite the short period of time, a car had appeared to his left that he didn’t notice. If he had just slept in his car that night, instead of trying to drive, perhaps all of this could have been avoided. Yet, he didn’t; you can’t turn back time no matter how hard you try. The rest of the memories came in fragments, and played almost like a slideshow. The horrid screech of metal grinding on metal. Fading in and out of consciousness. Sirens, presumably coming from rescue vehicles for him. And then there he was, laying down in a cat bed in the very shelter he would visit as a human. “Huh. So I guess my old life really is over,” Will thought and sighed. Soon after, he calmly fell asleep.<br>&emsp;
        Will woke up the next morning to the smell of cat food coming from somewhere in the kennel. He slowly got up, stretched, and walked over to the container it was sitting in to have some breakfast.  It wasn’t like the food he would eat as a human, but he was getting used to it.<br>&emsp;
        The morning went by like normal; people visited him, he ate and drank, and he took a couple short naps. However, one visitor caught Will’s eye more than any of the others. This visitor came in during the afternoon with one of the shelter staff members, and when Will saw him, he couldn’t believe his tiny, feline eyes. Standing right in front of his kennel was the human version of Will! The hair was the same, he had the same eye color, and he was even wearing the same clothes that Will used to wear; there was no doubt that it was human Will himself. Human Will bent down in front of kitten Will’s kennel. Turning to the staff member, he said, “His name is Cocoa, right? I think I’d like to adopt him.” “Cocoa… Where have I heard that name before?” kitten Will, now Cocoa thought. “Wait. That was my cat! I was my own cat!” He then started attempting to speak, but instead just meowed and meowed, unable to speak to the person on the other side. He remembered that day a long time ago when he adopted Cocoa. Will was 19, and he had just moved out to go to college. He was lonely without a family around him, despite how it sometimes annoyed him, and decided to get a cat to help those feelings leave. Cocoa was only about 4 months old at the time. He lived with Will for 6 years before he died. And now the whole thing has started over again.<br>&emsp;
        “Awww, it sounds like he’s trying to talk to me! Where do I start the adoption process?” Little did he know, Cocoa was trying to talk to him. The message just wasn’t getting through very well. Later that day, after Will finished filling out all the required papers, he visited Cocoa one last time before going home.
        “Hey little kitty,” he told the indeed small cat in front of him. “You’re going to be going home with me soon, OK?” Cocoa, unable to speak, just jumped up and down, meowing. Will laughed, then left the room, leaving only Cocoa and his feline companions to think to themselves. Cocoa thought a lot that night. He thought about his new life with himself (as a human), although he had an idea of what that would be like. He thought about how he would cope with being a cat without knowing anything about actually being a cat. But most of all, he thought about his past memories with Cocoa. Because of today’s events, he realized the nature of Cocoa’s (now his) friendly and outgoing personality. He also wondered about how Cocoa felt when he learned that Will died. All of this thinking tired him, and he fell into a deep sleep.<br>&emsp;
        First thing the next morning, Will came in to pick up Cocoa. Cocoa had woken up early in anticipation for the event. He remembered this day from his human life clear as crystal, but still wanted to see what happened during it. When Will entered the room with him, he started meowing and jumping like he had the day before. From his time as a cat he was getting pretty used to it. He learned how to give himself a bath, and was started to learn to like the food given to him. A staff member entered the room behind Will with a box that she would soon put Cocoa in along with some blankets and toys. But before this, Will had a few minutes to greet his future feline friend. He was as excited as Cocoa for the adoption. Five minutes later, the staff member stepped in and put Cocoa in the box. It was dark in there, but he was able to stand it. As soon as he got into the car, he dozed off.<br>&emsp;
        Cocoa was asleep for most of the ride home. The rumble of the car driving on the road was soothing to him, and he was able to stay in a deep sleep.  Periodically he would wake up and listen to the familiar and not so familiar sounds of the road (since he had a higher hearing range) and smell things he couldn’t have smelled before. But shortly after this moments he would fall asleep again. Sleeping seemed to be something he would do way more often that when he was a human. Maybe it was that he had more free time, or it was just another effect of being a cat. Whichever it was, Cocoa loved being able to sleep more. Who wouldn’t? When the both got home, Cocoa immediately recognized the room. 
        “Welcome to your new home, lil’ dude.” Will told Cocoa, smiling. He got out and ran around, elated to be back in the place he belonged.<br>&emsp;
        The next few years went by fairly quickly. Will and Cocoa both understood each other, despite the language barrier between them. Cocoa quickly grew up into an adult cat, but his personality never changed because of it. He was still as energetic as the kitten he was when he was first adopted. Even though he still had his humanity in him, Cocoa was more in tune with his feline form. Since he couldn’t do the things a human could do, he took up some new hobbies, like catching mice and sitting on anything he could find. It was a much simpler life, but Cocoa made it work.<br>&emsp;
        And he was happy.<br><br>

        For creative writing, my first skill I improved is descriptive language. In my first creative writing piece, I barely used any descriptive language to describe the events happening in the story. Sure, I told what events happened, but I didn’t really help the reader visualize what was happening, something that is required to make an interesting piece. However, in my second instance of creative writing, I used plenty of descriptive language. I still told the events like in my first piece, but I also implemented visually oriented sentences like, “Fluorescent lights are beaming down on the bright, white floor, and the mostly bare walls are painted a light, sky blue, dotted with various pictures of animals once housed in the public facility.” These help the reader immerse themselves further into the story. Descriptive language will be important in my future writing because it immerses the reader in the story. Without descriptive language, the story would be bland, and not engaging to the reader. With it, however, the writing is interesting, and the reader will want to keep reading.<br>&emsp;
        The second skill I improved in my creative writing pieces is voice. In the first piece I chose, my voice was not very apparent. Words like “saddest” and “moved” aren’t very effective at showing my voice through the writing. They are more general words, that might be better for professional writing that isn’t supposed to have any emotion in it, but for creative writing, they are better to be replaced by more emotional words. To contrast that, in my second piece of writing, I used lots of voice to enhance the quality of my piece. I used words like “beamed” and “lurched” to make the reader experience the writing, rather than observe it. I also used implemented other strategies, like sentence length, to strengthen my voice and keep the reader engaged. Voice is another skill helpful for future writing because it makes the story have some emotion in it, it makes the writing unique. Voice also helps keep the reader engaged in the story, because of the reasons I just listed.

          <span id='1'>1: Instead of "saddest", I should have used tragic, or another word to emphasize the voice.</span><br>
          <span id='2'>2: Could have used more descriptive language to help the readers empathize.</span><br>
          <span id='3'>3: Great use of descriptive language here, it really makes the reader visualize the setting the story is happening in. Also, using words like "beamed" and "bare" are words that help to emphasize my voice in the story.</span><br>
