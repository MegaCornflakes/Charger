        <span class='maintext'>Everyone has an opinion. And everyone has the right to that opinion. But that doesn’t mean that all opinions should be tolerated, especially hateful ones that can cause threats and violence.<a href='#1' class='note-link'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Tolerating all opinions sure hasn’t worked in the past, with the KKK having 6 million members at its peak. By speaking out against it, we were able to (mostly) get rid of it. Now, with the internet in billions of people’s homes, we need people like this more than ever. <br>
        &emsp; Not all opinions are equal. Someone can be against gay marriage, but not do any harm because of it, and that’s fine, even if you don’t agree, they can have that opinion. But when if gets to the point where people are being physically injured because of their attraction, this is where people need to stop. It goes the same way for opinions with good intentions.  Feminism is a great movement, all people should be equal, and as long as you don’t do more bad than good because of it, that’s a great opinion to have. Similarly to the first example, if you think an entire gender needs to be murdered because of your experience with a few guys, and cause people to be hurt, that’s not okay. It won’t bring anything good. As long as your opinions don’t bring any intentional harm to anyone, you can have them, and nobody should do anything to you because of them. <br>
        &emsp; It gets to a point, though, when under no circumstances should an opinion be tolerated because of how dangerous they are. For example, thinking that modern medicine (especially vaccines) is harmful is very dangerous not only to yourself, but also to any children you may have. Sure, there is a very small chance that they are allergic to a certain type of medicine, but there are plenty of alternatives that have been created because of these circumstances. In most cases, home remedies are not a good alternative to medicine. Many children get sick, some even dying, because of their parents not vaccinating them.<a href='#2' class='note-link'><sup>[2]</sup></a> This is child abuse, and a child dying because their parents didn’t medicate them against a treatable disease is essentially murder. Another dangerous opinion is thinking that obesity is healthy. Obesity is extremely unhealthy and failing to realize this could put you in a lot of danger, and could cost you a lot of money. <br>
        &emsp; In short, opinions are fine to have, as long as they don’t pose a threat to you or other people. Any other cases should be spoke up against to get things to stop, and to save people from harm. Even if there is no apparent threat some opinions are always dangerous. Wrapping things up, opinions are great things to have, just don’t cause any harm from them.<br><br>

        &emsp; Think back to the last time you had measles. You can’t? Good. That probably means you were vaccinated against measles sometimes in your life, and it made you immune to it. But what used to be a thing that everyone would get has turned into what seems to be optional! Over the past few years, more and more parents have stopped vaccinated their children, opening up their bodies to horrible diseases like measles and polio. Looking towards the future, how can we stop people from not vaccinating their kids? In order to solve this, I believe that the US should make vaccines mandatory for minors.<a href='#3' class='note-link'><sup>[3]</sup></a> <br> &emsp;
        Now you might be thinking, “What about all the people who can’t get vaccines? They could get hurt by mandatory vaccines!” In fact, according to healthline.com, the CDC recommends that certain people won’t get vaccinated because of certain health conditions they have.<a href='#4' class='note-link'><sup>[4]</sup></a> And they’re right. Certain people shouldn’t get vaccinated. But the CDC is also a government organization, and so a government vaccine mandate would probably follow the same rules that they made themselves. Plus, a law saying you have to get vaccinated wouldn’t be able to pass if it didn’t exclude people with the health conditions that make it impossible to get certain vaccines.<br> &emsp;
        Another reason someone wouldn’t want mandatory vaccines is because it goes against their religion and that it would be against the first amendment. People who don’t think vaccines are safe will use their religion as an excuse to not get them, even if their religion isn’t against vaccines. In fact, according to the Arizona Partnership for Immunization, most religions aren’t against vaccines and rather encourage them because they are a way of keeping you healthy. This basically means that people who don’t vaccinate their kids based on their religion are just abusing the first amendment to push forward their beliefs. Even if their religion does not support vaccines, your child getting sick or dying because of it shouldn’t be protected under the Constitution. Therefore, mandatory vaccines would not interfere with the freedom of religion in any way.
        Now that I’ve got all of your doubts out of the way, I’m going to move on to the first reason that I think we should we should mandate vaccines for minors. That is, there are many scientific studies that prove the benefits of vaccines. Research done by the NIAID, a government organization focused on infectious and allergic diseases, states that once your immune system learns how to fight off a disease, it can detect and kill of the disease quickly when you actually are infected so that you don’t have to suffer the symptoms. Vaccines help you learn how to fight a disease, without having to contract the disease. This shows that vaccines are made to help you become immune without any struggles, which is a huge benefit of having them. If we had mandatory vaccines for minors, they would be allowed to benefit from vaccines, instead of getting a horrible disease.<br> &emsp;
        Another important reason is that vaccinating not only helps you, but also helps the people around you. Information from vaccines.gov, a website by the HHS dedicated to informing about vaccines, illustrates how when you get vaccinated, you are less likely to pass on a disease to other people, because your immune system destroyed it before you could become contagious.  This means that when you get a vaccine, other people won’t get the disease if you get it. This also helps people who can’t get vaccines because of certain medical conditions. However, more and more people are getting these diseases, like measles, that no one is supposed to get because of the vaccine. If vaccines were mandatory, it would protect all the people who can’t get vaccines because the disease wouldn’t be spreading.<br> &emsp;
        The final reason I think vaccines should be mandatory is that not vaccinated has caused illness and death. Research from the NIAID says that in 1989, a measles outbreak occurred in the US due to a lack of vaccinations. The outbreak caused more than 55,000 people to get infected, and 136 people to die.<a href='#4' class='note-link'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Now, almost nobody gets measles anymore. This illustrates the importance of vaccines to public safety, because it’s shown that the lack of vaccination caused these deaths. If more people were vaccinated, the outbreak could have been avoided altogether. Mandatory vaccines would have forced people to immunize themselves, causing the above scenario to happen instead. In the years before 1963, before a measles vaccine even existed, an article from CNN reveals that 3 to 4 million people were infected with measles every year.<a href='#4' class='note-link'><sup>[4]</sup></a> This can’t just be a coincidence. If this only happened before the vaccine was out, then it means that the huge infection rate was solved by the vaccine, also meaning that not vaccinated caused the huge infection rate. If they had the vaccine back then, that infection rate would’ve gone way down.<br> &emsp;
        All in all, you now know why vaccines should be mandated by the US to help all the children living here. The reasons being all the proven benefits vaccines can give to you, how they also protect all the people around you, and that not vaccinating has caused illness and death. But how does all of this affect you? After all, you’re most likely already vaccinated, so why should you care? Well, you probably know at least one person who can’t get vaccinated, whether it be someone with a compromised immune system, or just an older person whose body can’t take the vaccine. Do you care about them not getting a disease? If you do, then you should support mandatory vaccinations so that they don’t get This means that we need to do something. You need to contact your representatives and get them to bring it up, talk to people who are skeptical about vaccines, tell them that there’s nothing to be afraid of, anything that you can do to make people more aware. But you can start by making sure you vaccinate yourself, and then maybe we can get rid of these diseases for good.<br><br>

        The first skill I chose to show growth in my argumentative writing skills is framing of evidence. In my first piece, I had no framing of evidence. In fact, I don’t think I even had any real evidence. I had a few points of evidence, like “Many children get sick, some even dying because of their parents not vaccinating them”, but that didn’t have any sources or anything else to validate the information to go with it. However, in the second piece, I improved my evidence a whole lot. Take this similar piece of evidence for an example: “Research from the NIAID says that in 1989, a measles outbreak occurred in the US due to a lack of vaccinations. The outbreak caused...136 people to die.” This says almost the same thing as in the first piece but it now has a source, the type of evidence presented, and it’s much more specific. I use this form of evidence presenting a lot throughout my piece. This skill is important in my future writing because it enables me to present good and reliable evidence in my essays. I can show that the claims I’m making in support of my side are backed up, and not just pulled out of nowhere.<br> &emsp;
        The second skill I chose to represent my growth in argumentative writing is a clear thesis statement. In my first piece, the thesis statement was not clear as all. In the first paragraph, it was mainly background information, but there was no real substance that could help the reader understand my thesis. The closest thing to a thesis is, “Now, with the internet in billions of people’s homes, we need people like this more than ever.” But that doesn’t really tell much about my thesis. Later in the year, in my second piece, my thesis comes out of the first paragraph very well. It still has background information, but it also has a sentence to set up the thesis. Then, the last sentence is used to convey the thesis to the reader. It even says, “In order to solve this, I believe”.  That “I Believe” is very effective at signaling to the reader that my opinion is going to be said in the sentence. This skill is important for future writing because it lets me get my point across to potential readers. When they read the thesis statement, they will immediately know what the writing is about, and what I think about the topic.
